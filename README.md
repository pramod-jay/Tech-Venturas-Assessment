## Implementation
Steps to implement and set up the project:
1. Clone the repo
    ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/pramod-jay/Tech-Venturas-Assessment.git
   ```
    
2. Database Implementation
  <br/>The MySQL database server is hosted on Azure flexible server, eliminating the need for database server implementation locally. Details regarding the database configuration can be found in the <b>‚Äòsrc/main/resources/application.properties‚Äô</b> file.

3. Open the project with a preferred IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA, VSCode.
   <br/>(Completion of successful opening will result in the project with the following folders and files)

## Assumptions
* A gateway requires a name and an IP address.
* Peripheral devices are not mandatory for a gateway; they can exist independently.
* Peripheral devices can also exist without being associated with a gateway.
* If a gateway is deleted, the connected peripheral devices may not be deleted; instead, the foreign keys indicating the devices' connection to the gateway will become null.
